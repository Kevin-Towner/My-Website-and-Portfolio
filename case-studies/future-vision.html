        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p class="content-paragraph-normal">Future Vision is a project that was completed in December, 2020, by myself and two other students at Drexel University. Future Vision was our capstone project for INFO-508, Information Innovation Through Design Thinking. The group originally decided to design a navigation-based application. Upon the completion of early steps in the design process, the group decided to focus on the stress and anxiety-inducing factors that can happen during a trip.

        </div> -->
        <h3>Empathy</h3>
        <p class="content-paragraph-normal">Prior to conducting any research, the group reflected on personal experiences related to planning or going through the process of taking a trip. As a whole, the group surmised that traveleing is, for the most part, unburdened by intense feelings. From an empathetic approach, the group decided to talk to 8 people, in loosely-scripted interactions, to yield transparent and genuine information on the way others view navigation. The discussions were held with participants of varrying careers, experiences, geographic locations, ages and ethnicities. The group learned that <span class="bold-text">the act of planning for and navigating between multiple destinations caused some levels of stress and anxiety for most participants regardless of how extensive the trip may be.</span></p>
        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <h4>• Brain-netting</h4>
        <p>To further explore the problem statement, the group <span class="bold-text">utilized brain-netting and group brainstorming as a primary means of expanding upon the ideas gained from the discussions</span> held during the empathy stage. By brain-netting, group members individually gathered 17 ideas, 51 ideas total, that could assist with the problem statement. Each group was assigned a color post-it note color and submitted their ideas, via a post-it, to the online <a class="case-study-anchor" href="https://stormboard.com/">Stormboard</a>. In the end, the group wound up with 47 solution ideas.</p>
        <h4>• Collaborative Review</h4>
        <div class="image-large-container">
          <img id="image-large--stormboard-1" class="image-large" src="../assets/images/misc/future-vision/stormboard-1.png" alt="Stormboard One, voting on ideas and identfying ideas with no votes">
          <span class="image-subtext">Stormboard One, initial vote</span>
        </div>
        <p>Group members met online via Zoom and collaboratively reviewed the solution ideas gathered in the stormboard. The review consisted of questions, answers and free-flow discussion with vritually no boundaries in regard to ideas or critiques. The exchange of ideas allowed us to weed out inadvertent duplicates and update the idea descriptions. <span class="bold-text">The group widdled the ideas down by assigning each group member 25 votes</span>. All group members were ultimately allowed to spend multiple votes per one idea if desired. After narrowing the scope down to 35 ideas, <span class="bold-text">the group voted for a 2nd time which narrowed the scope to 25 ideas</span>. The group then spent the remaining time giving each idea proper titles and descriptions.</p>

        <h4>• Final Three Designs</h4>
        <p style="margin-bottom:16px;">The group finalized the ideation process by narrowing down the remaining 25 ideas down to the final 5 ideas that group members believed to be the most promising. The group met via Zoom and for an impromptu discussion, narrowing down the final 25 ideas with a vote. Following the vote, the group was left with 5 ideas which were subsequently voted upon again revealing the final 3 ideas.</p>

        <h3>Testing and Experimentation</h3>
        <p>User validation through the use of prototyping was implemented in order to decide on which of the final three ideas the group would be moving forward with. Group collaboration was extremely necessary at this point in the process as the group needed to decide how the prototypes would be created and what features each prototype would illustrate. <span class="bold-text">Each group member created a clickable prototype, for a total of three prototypes, to be interacted with by test participants</span>. The "True View" and "Travel Wallet" prototypes were created in Adobe XD, and "Future Vision" was created using Sketch and Invision. Members kept those in the gorup informed on the prototype creation process and provided walkthroughs of their prototype with each other, providing and receiving questions and feedback.</p>
        <h4>• Participants</h4>
        <p style="margin-bottom:16px;">Each of the 3 tests were approximately 20 minutes long, with each test participant completing all three tests in one sitting. Each test began with an introduction, an explaination of group member roles, goals of the test, and permission of consent to record the test. Group members took turns between being the interviewer as the other two members were observers / note-takers. <span class="bold-text">Questions the interviewer asked were aimed to understand the participant's opinion on prototype functionality and ease-of-use</span>. Questions about missed opportunities, emotions during use, and necessary improvements were also included. There were a total of 3 test participants:</p>
        <ul class="description-list">
          <li style="font-weight:400;">• F, Social Media Analyst, 50s (Tester A)</li>
          <li style="font-weight:400;">• F, Marketing Manager, 30s (Tester B)</li>
          <li style="font-weight:400;">• M, Senior DevOps Manager, 40s (Tester C)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>• Scenerios</h4>
        <ul class="description-list">
          <li><span style="font-weight:500;">Scenerio 1:</span><br>A few weeks before the New Year’s Eve party, Jane plans out her travel. The trip is now closer to the current date
          and Jane wants to ensure that she can get to the party by 10:00 pm. She opens her Future Vision application, scrolls
          down the homepage, and clicks on her New Year's Eve party event. In the new screen presented, she is most
          interested in Weather Details, Add to Favorites, and Itinerary. Jane opens the Weather Details to see if there are
          any weather conditions for which she should be aware. Jane sees that it will be cold and snowy but is already
          prepared for this. Next, she double-checks that her itinerary gets her on the road in time to get to the party by
          10:00pm. Jane goes back to the New Year's Eve party overview and clicks on Itinerary. This brings up a list of all
          the steps that she and her parents discussed, including when to feed the kids! She sees that if she still she leaves her
          parents by 9:30pm, she will arrive by 10:00pm to the party.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li><span style="font-weight:500;">Scenerio 2:</span><br>It is three nights before the New Year's Eve party. Jane’s father heard that there is a winter storm coming in and
          asks Jane if there are any changes to her travel plans. Jane opens her Future Vision app and sees an alert icon on
          her New Year's Eve party! Jane clicks on the alert icon to see what is happening and is taken to the Weather Details
          for her party. There is a winter advisory that might affect her travels. At the bottom of the Weather Details screen,
          there is an Update Itinerary button. Jane taps the button and sees in order to still get to the party by 10:00pm, she
          will have to adjust her scheduled itinerary. The app lists adjustments to each item on her list. At the bottom of the
          screen, there is a Save Changes button to confirm the adjustments to her itinerary. Jane taps the button, and the
          changes save successfully! Now Jane must leave at 8:30pm to make it to her party safe and on time.

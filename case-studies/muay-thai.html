      <p>I began training in martial arts when I was in highschool at a gym that was reasonably close to my home. A friend and I had just gotten our driver's licences and we decided give BJJ (no-gi) a try. This was during a time when MMA, although picking up steam, was still relatively new. My friend and I were some of the only ones at our highschool, we knew of, who trained 'MMA' and we thought that was pretty awesome.
      <br><br>
      I discovered Muay Thai in college and became addicted to the art of 8 limbs.
      <br><br>
      I fell in love with the art of Muay Thai. Martial arts became something more than an activity that set me apart from those who did not partake. It became a lifestyle that reaped many benefits besides fighting ability. Running in the mornings and training in the evenings became part of my daily routine. When people would ask me if i'm training tonight, my reply would be, "Is that even a question?".
      </p>

      <h3>I was putting unnecessary pressure on myself and, in doing so, I lost my passion for Muay Thai</h3>

      <p>While progression in Muay Thai continued, I felt as if I was losing steam in my educational and professional career. Long story short, I stopped taking care of myself in the name of becoming "successfull". I was comparing myself to others and felt disatisfied because I didn't have as good of a job as this person, or I wasn't as smart as that person. <br><br>Yes, I gained a lot of knowledge in product design and user experience, but they were directionless and sought for the wrong reasons. I was putting unnecessary pressure on myself and lost my passion for training Muay Thai. <br><br>What I failed to accept was the fact that many of my accomplishments, outside of the gym, ran parralel to my accomplishments in the gym.

      </div>
      <p>Having slowly made the transition back to training almost everyday I decided to compete in a sanctioned amateur fight on June 26th, 2021. Training and interacting with my teammates at the gym has sparked a new fire inside of me in, as well as out of, the gym.<br><br>Here are four lessons Muay Thai, and specifically training for my first amateur fight, has taught me about changing careers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your corner</li>
        <li>Be adaptable</li>
        <li>Check the ego</li>
        <li>Focus on you</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id ="row-listen_to_your_corner">
      <h2><span>Your corner</span></h2>
      <p>
      Whether or not you're a fighter, you likely have people in your corner. Those people are your mentors, who dedicate their time and resources, because they see something special inside of you. They are your family who support your ambitions, even if those ambitions are unconventional and uncomfortable. They are your friends who cheer you on from the sidelines when you need that extra push.</p>
      <h3>If people in your corner aren't motivating you, it may be time to find new people</h3>
      <p>
      Your corner is comprised of people who want what's best for you and your development. They are the ones who are willing to tell you things you don't want to accept about yourself, but only to motivate you to become your best version. If the people in your corner aren't motivating you, it may be time to find new people.
      </p>
      <div class="image">
        <a target="_blank" class="image-anchor" href="../assets/images/me/me-2.png">
          <img class="image-100-image" src="../assets/images/me/me-2.png" alt="Listening to Kru (coach) Spyda between rounds"/>
        </a>
        <sub class="image-subscript">Kru (coach) 'Spyda' & teammate/fighter giving me advice inbetween sparring rounds</sub>
      </div>
      <p>Muay Thai and the people (in my corner) who I've met along my journey have given me the confidence to step outside of my comfort zone. They may not be huge lunges, but they're babysteps, leading to somebody better than I was the day before. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id="row-be_adaptable">
      <h2><span>Be adaptable</span></h2>
      <p>A couple weeks into my training for the fight, I found out my opponent would only agree to fight under K1 rules. For those who aren't familiar with Muay Thai, K1 and Muay Thai probably look similar but, those who are knowledgeable of Muay Thai, know that K1 and Muay Thai are basically two different sports.
      <br><br>
      Both sports include punches and kicks, but the techniques, scoring, and rules are very different. Now, about 22 days out from my fight, I have to adapt my style for more of a kickboxing fight. It is what it is, I wanted to fight, and I'm not letting a change of ruleset derail my success..
      </p>
      <div class="image">
        <a target="_blank" class="image-anchor" href="../assets/images/me/me-5.png">
          <img class="image-100-image" src="../assets/images/me/me-5.png" alt="Throwing the right hook at the pad"/>
        </a>
        <sub class="image-subscript">Throwing a right hook towards the thai pad.</sub>
      </div>
      <p>
        Changing careers is difficult, especially with lesser experience than a lot of the competition. So it's on me to find ways to acknowledge my lack of experience and turn it into a positive.
        <br><br>
        Everybody is out there fighting for what they believe is owed to them. Almost nobody is going to sacrifice their opportunities togive to you. It's up to you to find ways to show your strengths and work on your weaknesses.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id="row-check_the_ego">
      <h2><span>Check the ego</span></h2>
      <p>The best students are the ones who know to check their egos at the door before stepping on the mat. Nobody wants to work with a know-it-all or somebody who won't take direction. Going back to what was mentioned earlier, people who don't know how to manage their egos show to be unable to adapt and unwilling to listen to their corners.

      <h3>I feel like there are much newer students than I, who still manage to teach me something almost everytime I train.</h3>

      <p>The rate at which students are growing, in skill today, feels light-years ahead of when I started. It's extremely humbling to be caught, with a hard kick, by someone who just started 6 months ago, while I've been training for years.</p>

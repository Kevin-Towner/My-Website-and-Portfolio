      <p>I remember as soon as I got my licence, a friend and I decided to drive to an MMA gym in a neighboring town. I remember we signed the waver, despite not being full-fledged adults since we were only 17.
      <br><br>
      To this day, we still laugh about that incident because, had we decided to be truthful about our ages to the person working the front desk, I don't know if I'd be doing Muay Thai today.
      <br><br>
      My friend and I did conditioning and no-gi grappling classes. We both enjoyed it but as I gained more experience, I decided to focus on striking. While I was in college I found a Muay Thai/MMA gym that taught real Muay Thai.
      <br><br>
      I became addited to The Art of 8 Limbs.
      <br><br>
      I fell in love with the art of Muay Thai. It became something more than an aerobic activity. It became a lifestyle that reaped many benefits outside of fighting skills. Running in the mornings and training in the evenings became part of my daily routine. When people would ask me if i'm training tonight, my reply would be, "Is that even a question?".
      </p>

      <h3>I was putting unnecessary pressure on myself and lost my passion for Muay Thai</h3>

      <p>While progression in Muay Thai continued, I felt as if I was losing steam in my educational and professional career. Long story short, I stopped taking care of myself in the name of becoming "successfull". I was comparing myself to others and felt disatisfied because I didn't have as good of a job as this person, or I wasn't as smart as that person.
      <br><br>
      Yes, I gained a lot of knowledge in product design and user experience, but that knowledge was directionless. I was putting unnecessary pressure on myself and lost my passion for training Muay Thai.
      <br><br>
      What I failed to realize, or more like accept, was the fact that many of my accomplishments, outside the gym, ran parralel to my accomplishments in the gym.

      </div>
      <p>Having made the transition back to training almost everyday, I decided to compete in a sanctioned amateur fight on June 26th, 2021. Training and interacting with my teammates has sparked a new fire inside of me in, as well as out of, the gym.<br><br>Here are four lessons Muay Thai, and specifically training for my first amateur fight, has taught me about changing careers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your corner</li>
        <li>Be adaptable</li>
        <li>Check the ego</li>
        <li>Focus on you</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id ="row-listen_to_your_corner">
      <h2><span>Your corner</span></h2>
      <p>
      Whether or not you're a fighter, you likely have people in your corner. Those people are your mentors, who dedicate their time and resources, because they see something special inside of you. They are your family who support your ambitions, even if those ambitions are unconventional. They are your friends who cheer you on from the sideline when you need that extra push.</p>
      <h3>If people in your corner aren't motivating you, it may be time to find new people</h3>
      <p>
      Your corner is comprised of people who want what's best for your development. They're the ones willing to tell you things you may not want to acknowledge - because they're trying to motivate you. If the people in your corner aren't motivating you, it may be time to find new people.
      </p>
      <div class="image">
        <a target="_blank" class="image-anchor" href="../assets/images/me/me-2.png">
          <img class="image-100-image" src="../assets/images/me/me-2.png" alt="Listening to Kru (coach) Spyda between rounds"/>
        </a>
        <sub class="image-subscript">Kru (coach) 'Spyda' & teammate/fighter giving me advice inbetween sparring rounds</sub>
      </div>
      <p>Muay Thai and the people (in my corner) who I've met along my journey have given me the confidence to step outside of my comfort zone. They may not be huge lunges, but they're babysteps, leading to somebody better than I was the day before. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id="row-be_adaptable">
      <h2><span>Be adaptable</span></h2>
      <p>A couple weeks into my training for the fight, I found out my opponent would only agree to fight under K1 rules. For those who aren't familiar with Muay Thai, K1 and Muay Thai probably look fairly similar. Those who are knowledgeable in Muay Thai, know that K1 and Muay Thai are two different sports.
      <br><br>
      Muay Thai and K1 have their own set of rules, standards for scoring, and fight culture/mentalities.
      </p>
      <div class="image">
        <a target="_blank" class="image-anchor" href="../assets/images/me/me-5.png">
          <img class="image-100-image" src="../assets/images/me/me-5.png" alt="Throwing the right hook at the pad"/>
        </a>
        <sub class="image-subscript">Throwing a right hook towards the thai pad.</sub>
      </div>
      <p>
        Changing careers is difficult, especially when you have lesser experience than a lot of the competition. So it's on you find ways to acknowledge any lack of experience and turn it into a positive.
        <br><br>
        Always be looking for opportunities and always be ready to pivot. The fight game is constantly evolving with new schools of thought, trainers, gyms and styles - similarly to how industries grow and change. Companies want employees who can hit the ground running and come with a lean combination and hard and soft skills.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id="row-check_the_ego">
      <h2><span>Check the ego</span></h2>
      <p>The best students are the ones who check their egos at the door. Going back to what was mentioned earlier, people who don't know how to manage their egos show to be unable to adapt and unwilling to listen to their corners.

      <h3>I feel like there are much newer students than I, who still manage to teach me something almost everytime I train.</h3>

      <p>The rate at which students are growing, in skill today, feels light-years ahead of when I started. It's extremely humbling to be caught, with a hard kick, by someone who just started 6 months ago, while I've been training for years.
      <br><br>
      Putting your ego to the side isn't a testament to your lack of knowledge or skill nor does it mean others will see you as incompetent. You can still be knowledgeable while having a beginner's mindset which frees you from the internal pressure of always having something to prove.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id="row-focus_on_you">
      <h2><span>Focus on you</span></h2>
      <p>This lesson reminds me of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbecIBvR3mE">a scene</a> ,from the movie The Last Samurai, where Algren was learning how to use the wooden sword. After a couple unsuccessful attempts, Nobutada tells Algran, "too many mind". Only after this, Algran shows a hint of progression while also freeing himself of taking it too seriously.
      <br><br>
      This scene symbolizes the liberation that comes with pushing aside distraction, self-doubts and anxieties around what others think about you. The energy required to make a successful transition may be too much if you allow outside entities to weigh you down and hold you back.</p>
      <div class="image">

        </a>
        <sub class="image-subscript">Setting up an elbow</sub>
      </div>
      <p>You may encounter others who dislike the fact that you're attempting to reinvent yourself. Some of them may even be the ones who are currently in your corner. Embrace those who send good vibes your way and let that fuel the focus on your craft.
      <br><br>
      A great thing about Muay Thai is that it's one of the few places in civilized society where we get to excercise a part of us that, anywhere else, would be deemed as socially innapropriate. When you're yelling into the kick to give maximum power, you're not focused on what others think of you, and that's where progression begins</p>
